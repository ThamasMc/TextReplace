# Text Replace Script

## The Problem

There were times when we'd need to propogate some simple changes across an incredibly large number of files.

There are programs out there that might do something like this for you, but I figured why learn how to do it in something else when you can just write your own!

## The Future

This started off as a really specialized script, in the future I'd like to generalize its purpose and make it more OOP.
